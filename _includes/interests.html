        <p>Psychiatric disorders are common in our society. These disorders affect the brain
        and often cause tremendous personal distress. In my research as a Postdoctoral Fellow
        at Oxford University I focus on understanding brain connectivity in healthy and
        psychiatric conditions. Previous research has demonstrated
        that psychiatric disorders such as phobia, depression, and schizophrenia exhibit
        abnormalities in brain systems and their communication. I collaborate with
        mathematicians and statisticians, and I am particularly interested in new
        computational methods to explore brain connectivity. In the long run, new methods will
        hopefully improve the understanding, the diagnosis and the prognosis of such diseases,
        and may play an important role in personalized medicine in the future.</p>
